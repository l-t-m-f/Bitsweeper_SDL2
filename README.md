# Bitsweeper / Minesweeper game  

A simple Minesweeper game made with SDL 2.8 over a few day. Its left in a partial, but playable state.
You need SDL on your computer, for the CMakeLists to build properly.

I used bitwise operations to store the tile information into uint8's for the sake of exercise.

The art is mine. The font used is 8_BIT_WONDER.
